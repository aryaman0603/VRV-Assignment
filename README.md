Project Overview
The Admin Dashboard allows users to manage roles and users within an application. It includes features like:

User and Role management (Add, Edit, Delete)
Display of user roles and permissions
Sorting and searching of roles
Context-based state management for real-time updates
The application uses the React.js framework and Context API for state management, enabling efficient data flow and reactivity across the components.

Features
User Management:

Add, edit, and delete users.
Manage user roles and statuses (Active/Inactive).
Edit user details with form validation.
Role Management:

Create, edit, and delete roles.
Assign permissions to roles (Read, Write, Delete).
Role sorting and search functionality.
Context API:

Global state management for users and roles.
Data synchronization across components (Dashboard, User Management, Role Management).
Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Context API: A React feature for managing global state.
CSS: For styling the application.
React Router: For managing routing between different views (Dashboard, User Management, Role Management).
JavaScript (ES6+): For application logic and functionality.

Usage
After setting up the project, you can:

Dashboard: View the active roles and users count.
Role Management: Add, edit, delete, and search roles. Assign permissions to each role.
